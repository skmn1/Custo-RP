## 8. Edge Cases & Notes

### 8.1 Empty States

**No Employees:**
- Message: "No employees found"
- Action: "Add Employee" button in Employees page
- Impact: Scheduler cannot add shifts without employees
- Scheduler shows: Empty employee list with message

**No Shifts:**
- Message: "No shifts scheduled for this week"
- Action: "Add Shift" button
- Impact: Statistics panel shows zeros
- Visual: Calendar shows all empty cells

**No Payroll Data:**
- Occurs when: No shifts for selected period OR too early in week
- Message: "No payroll data available for selected period"
- Shows: All statistics as zero or N/A

### 8.2 Data Validation Issues

**Duplicate Employee Names:**
- Allowed (multiple Johns possible)
- Recommended: Use unique emails to identify

**Invalid Time Ranges:**
- Start time = End time: Prevented (error message, planned)
- End time < Start time: Handled with overnight shift logic
- Example: 23:00-07:00 = 8 hour overnight shift ✓

**Negative Hours:**
- Prevented at input level
- Number fields have min="0"

**Excessive Hours:**
- Technically possible to exceed 168 hours/week
- Warning shown (planned) if exceeds max hours
- Overtime calculated correctly regardless

### 8.3 Cross-page Consistency

**Employee Updates:**
- Add/edit/delete on Employees page
- Immediately reflected in Scheduler shifts
- Payroll calculated based on current employee data

**Shift Updates:**
- Add/edit/delete on Scheduler page
- Payroll auto-recalculates
- Statistics update instantly

**Data Isolation:**
- No employee can appear twice
- No duplicate shifts for same employee/day (planned)
- Shifts belong to specific employees (not generic)

### 8.4 Browser Compatibility

**Supported Browsers:**
- Chrome 100+ ✓
- Firefox 100+ ✓
- Safari 15+ ✓
- Edge 100+ ✓

**Not Supported:**

### 8.5 Performance Considerations

**Scalability Limits (Current Mock Data):**
- ~50 employees: Fully responsive
- ~100 employees: Some lag in list rendering
- ~200+ employees: Virtual scrolling recommended (planned)

**Shift Limits:**
- ~500 shifts: Smooth drag-and-drop
- ~1000+ shifts: May experience slowdown

**Payroll Calculations:**
- Real-time calculation up to ~100 employees
- Calculation time: <100ms for typical dataset

**Storage:**
- Mock data stored in browser memory
- No persistent storage without backend
- Data lost on page refresh

1. **No Data Persistence** — Data resets on page refresh
2. **No Authentication** — Anyone can access all features
3. **No Permissions** — No role-based restrictions
4. **No Notifications** — No email/SMS alerts
5. **Limited Error Handling** — Minimal error messages

**Introduced:** April 11, 2026  
**Scope:** ESS mobile screens only (`src/styles/mobile.css`, `tailwind.config.js`)  
**Colour mode:** Light only (dark mode removed in Task 76)

### Tailwind Theme (tailwind.config.js)

Key colour aliases available as Tailwind utilities:

- `bg-primary` → `#da336b`
- `bg-surface-container-lowest` → `#ffffff` (card fill)
- `bg-primary-container` → `#ffdae2`
- `bg-error-container` → `#ffdad6`
- `shadow-editorial` → `0 8px 24px rgba(218,51,107,0.06)`
- `shadow-card` → `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.04)`
- `shadow-nav` → `0 -2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`

- `font-body` / `font-label` → `Manrope`

### Font Stacks

### Primitive Components

| Component | File | Task 77 Changes |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| `MobileCard` | `src/components/mobile/MobileCard.jsx` | 24px radius (`rounded-3xl`), `shadow-editorial`, Magenta active accent |
| `AccentCard` | same file | Gradient left bar `from-primary to-secondary-fixed` |
| `StatusChip` | `src/components/mobile/StatusChip.jsx` | Magenta palette for approved/pending/active; error-container for declined |
| `MobileTopBar` | `src/components/mobile/MobileTopBar.jsx` | Material Symbols bell icon, Magenta badge, headline font |
| `TopAppBar` | same file | Sprint 22 standard bar — avatar + ESS brand + Material Symbols bell |

### Icon Library — Material Symbols Outlined

All sprint 22 screens use Google Material Symbols Outlined loaded via `index.html`.

**Usage:**
```jsx
// Outlined (default)
<span className="material-symbols-outlined">home</span>

// Filled (active state)
<span className="material-symbols-outlined" style={{ fontVariationSettings: "'FILL' 1" }}>home</span>

// Helper component
export const Icon = ({ name, filled = false, className = '' }) => (
  <span
    className={`material-symbols-outlined ${className}`}
    style={filled ? { fontVariationSettings: "'FILL' 1" } : undefined}
  >
    {name}
  </span>
);
```

**Key icon names:** `home`, `calendar_today`, `pending_actions`, `person`, `notifications`, `payments`, `download`, `swap_horiz`, `timer`, `calendar_month`, `health_and_safety`, `event_repeat`, `campaign`, `location_on`, `trending_up`, `arrow_forward`, `chevron_left`, `more_vert`


---

## Navigation Shell — ESS Bottom Nav (Task 78, Sprint 22)

**Introduced:** April 11, 2026  
**Component:** `src/components/mobile/BottomNav.jsx`  
**Shell:** `src/components/mobile/MobileShell.jsx`

### 4-Tab Structure

| Tab | Icon (Material Symbol) | Route | Active when |
|-----|----------------------|-------|-------------|
| Home | `home` (filled when active) | `/app/ess/dashboard` | `pathname.startsWith('/app/ess/dashboard')` |
| Schedule | `calendar_today` (filled when active) | `/app/ess/schedule` | `pathname.startsWith('/app/ess/schedule')` |
| Requests | `pending_actions` (filled when active) | `/app/ess/requests` | `pathname.startsWith('/app/ess/requests')` |
| Profile | `person` (filled when active) | `/app/ess/profile` | `pathname.startsWith('/app/ess/profile')` |

Secondary routes (no tab — accessible via cards/top-bar):
- `/app/ess/payroll` — Payroll Hub (linked from Dashboard)
- `/app/ess/payroll/:id` — Payslip Detail
- `/app/ess/notifications` — Notification Centre (linked from top-bar bell)

### Active State Behaviour

- **Active icon:** Material Symbol with `fontVariationSettings: "'FILL' 1"` — solid/filled appearance  
- **Active colour:** `#da336b` (Magenta primary)  
- **Active background:** `bg-[#ffdae2] rounded-xl px-3 py-1` (primary-container pill)  
- **Inactive icon:** Material Symbol default (outlined, `'FILL' 0`)  
- **Inactive colour:** `text-zinc-500`  
- **Labels:** Permanent on all tabs (11px semibold uppercase)

### Safe Area

`pb-safe` (`env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`) is applied via the `pb-safe` utility class defined in `src/styles/mobile.css`. Main content padding uses `pb-32` to clear the frosted nav bar + safe area on all devices.

### Accessibility

- `role="navigation"` + `aria-label` (from `mobile.nav.label` i18n key)
- `aria-current="page"` on the active `NavLink`
- Each tab is a `NavLink` with visible label — no icon-only buttons

### i18n Keys (`ess` namespace, `mobile.nav` section)

| Key | EN | FR |
|-----|----|----|
| `mobile.nav.label` | "Main navigation" | "Navigation principale" |
| `mobile.nav.dashboard` | "Home" | "Accueil" |
| `mobile.nav.schedule` | "Schedule" | "Planning" |
| `mobile.nav.requests` | "Requests" | "Demandes" |
| `mobile.nav.profile` | "Profile" | "Profil" |
| `mobile.nav.notifications` | "Alerts" | "Alertes" |

### Desktop Behaviour

`<BottomNav>` is rendered inside `<MobileShell>`, which is only mounted at viewports `< 1024px`. Desktop layouts use the sidebar navigation — the bottom nav is never visible at ≥ 1024px.

---

## Auth Screens — ESS Mobile Login & Password Reset (Task 79, Sprint 22)

**Introduced:** April 11, 2026  
**Components:**
- `src/pages/ess/mobile/MobileLoginPage.jsx` — SCREEN_128
- `src/pages/ess/mobile/MobileResetPasswordPage.jsx` — SCREEN_129

**Design System:** Nexus Kinetic (Task 77) — Magenta primary, Plus Jakarta Sans headings, Manrope body  
**Shell:** Standalone full-screen routes — no `<MobileShell>`, no bottom nav

### Routes

| Path | Desktop | Mobile (< 1024px) |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `/login` | `DevLoginPage` | `MobileLoginPage` |
| `/login/classic` | `LoginPage` | `LoginPage` |
| `/forgot-password` | `MobileResetPasswordPage` | `MobileResetPasswordPage` |

Route selection uses `useMobileLayout()` — the hook fires on breakpoint crossing (1024px threshold).

### Login Screen (SCREEN_128) — MobileLoginPage

**Layout:**  
- Mobile (< 768px): Single-column centred form, warm white background
- Tablet/Desktop (≥ 768px): Two-column split — Magenta brand panel (left) + form panel (right)

**Form elements:**
- Email input with `person` Material Symbol icon at left; `border-b-2 focus:border-[#da336b]` underline effect
- Password input with `lock` icon + visibility toggle (`visibility`/`visibility_off` icons); `aria-label` on toggle button
- `Forgot Password?` link → `/forgot-password`
- **Primary CTA:** "Sign In" — Magenta gradient (`#da336b` → `#8b2044`), `rounded-2xl`, arrow icon
- **Tonal button:** "Use Biometric Login" — `bg-[#f2dee1]`, `text-[#da336b]`, face icon filled; logs `console.warn` as placeholder
- Footer: "Request Access Link" text link (Magenta)

**Auth integration:**
- Calls `useAuth().login(email, password)` from `src/hooks/useAuth.jsx`
- Local `isLoading` / `error` state (the shared hook doesn't expose these)
- Client-side validation: email regex, password ≥ 8 characters; inline `role="alert"` error messages
- On success: navigates to `/app/ess/dashboard`

### Password Reset Screen (SCREEN_129) — MobileResetPasswordPage

**Layout:** Centred glass-card with ambient Magenta orbs in background; mobile quick-action bar (Call Us / Chat / FAQ) pinned to bottom.

**Form elements:**
- Back button `arrow_back` → `navigate(-1)`; `aria-label="Back to Login"`
- `lock_reset` icon badge (filled, Magenta)
- Email input with `mail` icon
- **Primary CTA:** "Send Reset Link" — same Magenta gradient; `send` icon
- Security tile: `verified_user` icon — link expiry notice
- Support tile: `support_agent` icon — IT contact

**API integration:**
- Calls `forgotPasswordApi(email)` from `src/api/authApi.js` (POST `/auth/forgot-password`)
- Email enumeration prevention: non-503 errors show success state
- Success banner: `check_circle` icon, `role="status"`; submit button disabled after success

**Validation:** Email required + regex format; inline `role="alert"` error.

### i18n Keys (`ess` namespace, `auth` section)

| Key | EN | FR |
|-----|----|----|
| `auth.appName` | "ESS" | "ESS" |
| `auth.welcomeBack` | "Welcome Back" | "Bon retour" |
| `auth.loginSubtitle` | "Sign in to your employee portal." | "Connectez-vous à votre portail employé." |
| `auth.email` | "Email address" | "Adresse e-mail" |
| `auth.password` | "Password" | "Mot de passe" |
| `auth.forgotPassword` | "Forgot Password?" | "Mot de passe oublié ?" |
| `auth.signIn` | "Sign In" | "Se connecter" |
| `auth.biometricLogin` | "Use Biometric Login" | "Connexion biométrique" |
| `auth.resetTitle` | "Reset Password" | "Réinitialiser le mot de passe" |
| `auth.sendResetLink` | "Send Reset Link" | "Envoyer le lien de réinitialisation" |
| `auth.resetSuccess` | "Reset link sent! Please check your inbox." | "Lien de réinitialisation envoyé ! Vérifiez votre messagerie." |

### Accessibility

- All inputs have associated `<label>` elements
- Field errors rendered with `role="alert"` below each input
- Global error banner has `role="alert"`
- Reset success banner has `role="status"`
- Biometric and visibility-toggle buttons have descriptive `aria-label`
- All interactive elements ≥ 44×44pt (`min-h-[44px]`)

## Mobile Dashboard — ESS Nexus Kinetic (Task 80)

**Screen:** SCREEN_39  
**Route:** `/app/ess/dashboard` (inside `<EssLayout>`)  
**File:** `src/pages/ess/mobile/MobileDashboardPage.jsx`  
**Branch:** `feature/80-ess-mobile-dashboard`

### Layout

Full-screen single-column scroll on mobile. At `md:` breakpoint, renders a 12-column bento grid: Shift Hero (col-span-8) | Leave Card (col-span-4) | Company Pulse (col-span-12).

### Sections

| Section | Component | Data source |
|---|---|---|
| Greeting header | `EssDashboardGreeting` | `dashboard.greeting.firstName` + `new Date()` |
| Next Shift hero | `NextShiftHero` | `dashboard.upcomingShifts[0]` |
| Annual Leave card | `LeaveBalanceCard` | `dashboard.leaveBalance` (defaults: used=0, total=21) |
| Company Pulse carousel | `CompanyPulseCarousel` | `dashboard.companyNews` (defaults: []) |
| Quick Links grid | `QuickLinks` | Static links: Payroll Hub, My Profile, Leave & Time, Schedule |

### Time-Based Greeting Logic

| Hour range | i18n key | EN | FR |
|---|---|---|---|
| 00:00–11:59 | `mobile.dashboard.goodMorning` | Good morning | Bonjour |
| 12:00–17:59 | `mobile.dashboard.goodAfternoon` | Good afternoon | Bon après-midi |
| 18:00–23:59 | `mobile.dashboard.goodEvening` | Good evening | Bonsoir |

### Next Shift Hero Card

- Magenta left accent bar (`linear-gradient(to bottom, #da336b, #8b2044)`, absolute 6px wide)
- Date formatted using `Intl.DateTimeFormat` (weekday long, day numeric, month short)
- Time + duration row with `schedule` Material Symbol
- Location row with `location_on` Material Symbol
- Footer: team avatar stack (max 4) + "Clock In" gradient CTA button
- **Clock In CTA navigates to `/app/ess/schedule`** — actual time-tracking is a future feature
- Empty state: `event_busy` icon + `mobile.dashboard.noUpcomingShift` text (neutral card, no accent bar)

### Annual Leave Card

- Full-width gradient surface: `linear-gradient(135deg, #8b003b 0%, #da336b 100%)`
- `remaining` days computed as `total - used`
- Progress bar: `<div role="progressbar" aria-valuenow={used} aria-valuemin={0} aria-valuemax={total}>`
- White fill bar, `transition-all duration-700`
- "Request Time Off" tonal button → navigates to `/app/ess/schedule` (leave request flow is future)
- Decorative white-opacity orbs for visual depth

### Company Pulse Carousel

- Horizontal `overflow-x-auto` with `snap-x snap-mandatory`
- Scrollbar hidden via `[scrollbar-width:none] [&::-webkit-scrollbar]:hidden`
- Each card: 220px wide, `snap-center`, optional banner image (lazy loaded), category badge, title (2-line clamp), date
- Only renders when `companyNews.length > 0` (no empty state placeholder)

### Quick Links Grid

2-column `grid grid-cols-2 gap-3`. Static links:

| Icon | Label key | Route |
|---|---|---|
| `payments` (filled) | `mobile.dashboard.payrollHub` | `/app/ess/payslips` |
| `badge` (filled) | `mobile.dashboard.myProfile` | `/app/ess/profile` |
| `beach_access` | `mobile.dashboard.leaveTime` | `/app/ess/schedule` |
| `calendar_today` | `mobile.nav.schedule` | `/app/ess/schedule` |

### Desktop Coexistence

`EssDashboardPage.jsx` checks `useMobileLayout()` (1024px breakpoint):
- Mobile → renders `<MobileDashboardPage />` (this task)
- Desktop → renders the original multi-column widget grid (task 54, unchanged)

### i18n Keys Added (`mobile.dashboard` namespace)

New keys in both `en/ess.json` and `fr/ess.json`:

| Key | EN | FR |
|---|---|---|
| `essPortal` | Employee Self-Service | Espace Employé |
| `noUpcomingShift` | No upcoming shifts scheduled | Aucun quart à venir |
| `clockIn` | Clock In | Pointer |
| `annualLeave` | Annual Leave | Congés annuels |
| `daysLeft` | days left | jours restants |
| `leaveProgress` | {{used}} of {{total}} days used | {{used}} sur {{total}} jours utilisés |
| `requestTimeOff` | Request Time Off | Demander un congé |
| `companyPulse` | Company Pulse | Actualités |
| `seeAll` | See All | Voir tout |
| `quickLinks` | Quick Links | Accès rapides |
| `payrollHub` | Payroll Hub | Fiches de paie |
| `myProfile` | My Profile | Mon profil |
| `leaveTime` | Leave & Time | Congés & temps |
| `view` | View | Voir |

### Accessibility Checklist

- [x] Leave bar: `role="progressbar"`, `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin="0"`, `aria-valuemax`
- [x] All decorative icons have `aria-hidden="true"`
- [x] Clock In button has `aria-label` from i18n

- [x] Company Pulse carousel has `role="list"` + `aria-label`
- [x] Each carousel item has `role="listitem"`
- [x] Greeting section has `data-testid="mobile-dashboard-greeting"`

### Loading & Error States

- **Loading:** `<MobileDashboardSkeleton />` — pulsing grey placeholders for all sections. Shown when `isLoading && !dashboard`.
- **Error:** `<MobileDashboardError onRetry={refetch} />` — error icon, "Unable to load" text, Magenta retry button. Shown when `error && !dashboard`.
- Stale data falls through to render dashboard with previous data.

### Unit Tests

`tests/mobile-dashboard-nexus.test.js` — 57 tests:
- `getGreetingKey()` boundary checks (0, 6, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 21, 23)
- Leave bar `%` calculation (0%, 57%, 100%, overflow cap, null/undefined)
- EN/FR i18n key presence and interpolation placeholder checks
- Source structural assertions: testids, aria attributes, routes, gradient colours, scroll classes

---

## Work Schedule — ESS Nexus Kinetic (Task 81)

**Screen:** SCREEN_103  
**Route:** `/app/ess/schedule` (inside `<EssLayout>`)  
**File:** `src/pages/ess/mobile/MobileSchedulePage.jsx`  
**Branch:** `feature/81-ess-mobile-schedule`

### Layout

Single-column scroll. Calendar picker at top, shift list below.

### Components

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ScheduleCalendar` | Monthly grid, previous/next month nav, shift dots, selected day fill |
| `ShiftList` | Filters `shifts[]` to `selectedDate`, renders empty state or list |
| `ShiftCard` | Individual shift — date box, time, role, location tag, Request Swap CTA |
| `MobileScheduleSkeleton` | Pulse placeholders while loading |

### Monthly Calendar Grid

Helper `buildMonthGrid(monthDate)`:
- Returns an array padded to full ISO weeks (Mon – Sun)
- Padding cells are `null` (rendered as empty `gridcell` with `aria-hidden`)
- Length is always a multiple of 7

Day cell states:

| State | Visual |
|---|---|
| Selected | `bg-primary text-on-primary shadow-lg` |
| Today (not selected) | `ring-2 ring-primary text-primary font-bold` |
| Has shift | Magenta 4px dot at `bottom-1` (`bg-primary`, white when selected) |
| Out-of-month | `text-outline/40` (dimmed) |
| Default | `text-on-surface hover:bg-surface-container` |

Accessibility: each day button has `aria-label` with full date string, `aria-pressed={isSelected}`, `aria-current="date"` on today.  
Calendar container: `role="grid"` + `aria-label`. Day cells: `role="gridcell"`.

### Month Navigation

Delegated to `useEssSchedule()` hook:
- `navigatePrev` / `navigateNext` change the hook's `anchor` date
- Hook is set to `viewMode='month'` so it fetches the full calendar month range: `GET /api/ess/schedule?from=YYYY-MM-01&to=YYYY-MM-DD`
- Month title uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with `aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"`

### Shift Card

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| Left accent bar | Magenta gradient for today's shifts; muted grey for future |
| Date box | Square tile (`w-14 h-14`) with day number + month abbr in `text-primary` |
| Time range | `startTime – endTime · duration` with `schedule` Material Symbol |
| Role | `text-on-surface-variant` below time |
| Location | `location_on` Material Symbol icon + `locationName ?? location` field |
| Status badge | `confirmed` → `bg-primary-container/40 text-primary`; `pending` → `bg-primary-fixed/50`; others → error |
| Request Swap | Magenta filled button — navigates to swap flow (placeholder, logs to console in this sprint) |

### Empty State

`event_available` icon + `mobile.schedule.noShifts` text, neutral card `bg-surface-container-lowest`.

### Desktop Coexistence

`EssSchedulePage.jsx` checks `useMobileLayout()` (1024px breakpoint):
- Mobile → `<MobileSchedulePage />`
- Desktop → existing `ScheduleHeader / WeekView / MonthView` (task 49, unchanged)

All hooks (`useEssSchedule`, `useEssConnectivity`, `useMobileLayout`) are called at the top of `EssSchedulePage` before any conditional return to comply with React's rules of hooks.

### i18n Keys Added (`mobile.schedule`)

New keys in both `en/ess.json` and `fr/ess.json`:

| Key | EN | FR |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | Work Schedule | Planning |
| `workforceLabel` | Workforce Management | Gestion du personnel |
| `previousMonth` | Previous month | Mois précédent |
| `nextMonth` | Next month | Mois suivant |
| `calendarLabel` | Monthly shift calendar | Calendrier mensuel des quarts |
| `today` | Today | Aujourd'hui |
| `noShifts` | No shifts scheduled for this day | Aucun quart prévu ce jour |
| `shiftSingular` | shift | quart |
| `shiftPlural` | shifts | quarts |
| `requestSwap` | Request Swap | Demander un échange |
| `statusConfirmed` | Confirmed | Confirmé |
| `statusPending` | Pending | En attente |
| `statusSwapRequested` | Swap Requested | Échange demandé |

### Accessibility Checklist

- [x] Calendar `role="grid"`, day cells `role="gridcell"`
- [x] Selected day: `aria-pressed={isSelected}`
- [x] Today: `aria-current="date"`
- [x] Month heading: `aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"`
- [x] Month nav buttons: `aria-label` from i18n
- [x] Shift cards: accessible `aria-label` on Request Swap including date
- [x] All decorative icons: `aria-hidden="true"`

### Unit Tests

`tests/mobile-schedule-nexus.test.js` — 62 tests:
- `buildMonthGrid()`: cell count, Monday-first padding, April 2026 layout, Feb/Jan
- `toDateString()`: ISO format, zero-padding, year-end
- ShiftList filtering: multi-shift days, ISO datetime strings, null guards

### Payroll Hub Layout

```
Editorial header (Financial Overview / Payroll Hub)
├── YTD hero card (Magenta gradient, lg:col-span-2)
│   ├── YTD earnings figure
│   ├── Period label
│   └── Progress bar (role=progressbar, paid months / 12)
└── Current period card (border-l-4 border-primary, lg:col-span-1)
    ├── Net pay + gross pay
    └── View Payslip button → /app/ess/payroll/:id

Financial Tools (2-col / 4-col grid)

  bar_chart → Analytics

Recent Activity (conditional — only when data.recentActivity is non-empty)
```

### Payslip Detail Layout

```
Back button (navigate(-1))
Payslip title + pay date
Net pay hero (Magenta gradient, mx-6)
  ├── Net Pay figure (5xl)
  └── Gross / Deductions summary line

md+ bento: earnings (col-8) | deductions (col-4)
PayslipSection — Earnings
  base salary, overtime (with hours), bonuses[]
  subtotal row: Gross Pay

PayslipSection — Deductions (negative=true → text-error, '−' prefix)
  deductions[]
  subtotal row: Total Deductions

Employer Contributions (bg-primary-container/30 tinted card)
  employerContributions[] (conditional — only if non-empty)

PDF download: <a href="/api/ess/payslips/:id/pdf" download>
  aria-label uses t('mobile.payroll.downloadPdfLabel', { period })
```

### History Search & Filter

- Search input filters `period` (or `periodLabel`) case-insensitively via `String.includes`
- Year dropdown: derived from unique years across the **full unfiltered** payslip list
- `selectedYear=null` shows all years; selecting a year hides other groups
- Groups rendered newest year first (sorted descending)
- Each row: period label + status chip + net pay → tap to navigate to detail
- Inline download: `<a href="/api/ess/payslips/:id/pdf" download>` per row

### Desktop Coexistence

Routes at `/app/ess/payroll/*` are new and do not replace the existing `/app/ess/payslips` and `/app/ess/payslips/:id` desktop routes. The quick-link on the Dashboard page already links to `/app/ess/payslips`; the payroll hub is accessible via the quick-links icon `payrollHub` on the dashboard or direct navigation.

### i18n (36 keys)

All strings live under `mobile.payroll.*` in `public/locales/{en,fr}/ess.json`.

| Key | EN | FR |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | Payroll Hub | Tableau de paie |
| `ytdEarnings` | Year-to-Date Earnings | Salaire cumulé (YTD) |
| `netPay` | Net Pay | Salaire net |
| `grossPay` | Gross Pay | Salaire brut |
| `downloadPdf` | Download PDF | Télécharger PDF |
| `historyTitle` | Payslip History | Historique des fiches |
| `employerContributions` | Employer Contributions | Cotisations patronales |
| `downloadPdfLabel` | Download payslip for {{period}} | Télécharger la fiche de paie pour {{period}} |

### Accessibility

- YTD progress bar: `role="progressbar"`, `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin=0`, `aria-valuemax=100`, `aria-label`
- PDF download anchor: `aria-label={t('mobile.payroll.downloadPdfLabel', { period })}` (on both Detail and History pages)
- All Material Symbol `<span>` elements: `aria-hidden="true"`
- Section headings: `h1` (page title), `h2` (section titles)
- Touch targets: all interactive elements use `p-5` or `py-3/py-4` padding (≥ 44px)

### Loading & Error States

| View | State | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Payroll Hub | `isLoading` | `MobilePayrollSkeleton` (animate-pulse) |
| Payroll Hub | `error` | `MobilePayrollError` with retry button |
| Payroll Hub | `!data` | Falls through to skeleton |
| Payslip Detail | `isLoading` | `MobilePayslipSkeleton` |
| Payslip Detail | `error=restricted` | `t('mobile.payroll.restricted')` |
| Payslip Detail | other error | Error message + retry |
| History | `isLoading` | `MobileHistorySkeleton` |
| History | no results after filter | Empty state with `receipt_long` icon |

### Unit Tests

`tests/mobile-payroll-nexus.test.js` — **156 tests, all passing**

- `getPayYear()` — extracts year from `payDate`, `paidAt`, fallback to current year
- `filterPayslips()` — case-insensitive search on `period`/`periodLabel`
- `groupByYear()` — groups payslips by integer year, handles edge cases
- `ytdProgress()` — percentage clamped at 100, null/undefined safe
- EN + FR i18n key presence and value assertions (36 + 20 keys)
- Source structural assertions: testids, aria attrs, Magenta gradients, anchor download, hooks imports, route ordering

## Task 84 — ESS Employee Profile & Edit (SCREEN_67 + SCREEN_97)

### Overview

Two views forming the ESS "Profile" bottom-navigation tab. `MobileProfilePage` presents a read-only hero view; `MobileEditProfilePage` provides an inline edit form.

**Routes:**
- `/app/ess/profile` → `MobileProfilePage`
- `/app/ess/profile/edit` → `MobileEditProfilePage`

### Hook

| Hook | Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `useEssProfile` *(existing)* | `GET /api/ess/profile` | `{ profile, isLoading, error, ... }` |
| `useEssUpdateProfile` *(new)* | `PATCH /api/ess/profile` | `{ updateProfile, isLoading, error }` |

`useEssUpdateProfile` sends partial fields (`phone`, `email`, `emergencyContact`, `workPreferences`, `preferredLocation`) as JSON; triggers re-navigation on success.

### MobileProfilePage (SCREEN_67)

#### Sections

| Section | Component | testid |
|---|---|---|
| Hero header | `ProfileHeader` | `profile-header` |
| Avatar image | *(img)* | `profile-avatar` |
| Name heading | *(h1)* | `profile-name` |
| Active score badge | *(div)* | `cert-badge` |
| SVG ring card | *(div)* | `cert-ring-card` |
| SVG ring element | *(svg)* | `cert-ring-svg` |
| Ring progress arc | *(circle)* | `cert-ring-progress` |
| Personal info card | `InfoSection` | `info-section` / `info-row` |
| Work preference chips | `WorkPreferenceTags` | `work-preferences` / `preference-chip` |
| Location history | `LocationHistory` | `location-history` / `location-row` |
| Edit CTA | *(button)* | `edit-profile-btn` |
| Loading skeleton | `MobileProfileSkeleton` | `profile-skeleton` |

#### SVG Certification Ring Geometry

- Viewport: `0 0 96 96`, centre `cx=48 cy=48`, radius `r=45`
- Circumference: $2\pi \times 45 \approx 282.74$
- `strokeDashoffset = 282.74 \times (1 - \text{score}/100)`
- Ring starts from top (12 o'clock) via `transform: rotate(-90deg)` on `<svg>`
- Stroke: `#da336b` (Nexus Magenta); track: `stroke-surface-container`
- Default score when API returns `null`: **85**

#### PREF_ICONS mapping

| Key | Material Symbol |
|---|---|
| `fastFood` | `lunch_dining` |
| `grocery` | `shopping_cart` |
| `butcher` | `kitchen` |
| `bakery` | `bakery_dining` |
| `cafe` | `coffee` |

### MobileEditProfilePage (SCREEN_97)

#### Form Fields

| Field | Input type | testid |
|---|---|---|
| Phone Number | `tel` | `input-phone` *(via config)* |
| Email | `email` | `input-email` *(via config)* |
| Emergency Contact | `text` | `input-emergency` *(via config)* |

Each field rendered from the `contactFields` config array with `<label htmlFor={field.testid}>` and `<input id={field.testid} data-testid={field.testid}>` for full ARIA association.

#### Work Preferences Edit

- Active chips: `pref-chip-{pref}` with remove button `remove-pref-{pref}` (`aria-label="Remove {label}"`)
- Add buttons: `add-pref-{pref}` with `aria-label="Add Preference {label}"`
- Available preferences: `fastFood`, `grocery`, `butcher`, `bakery`, `cafe`

#### Location Selector

3-button toggle: Downtown / Westside / Northgate. Selected state uses Magenta gradient; `aria-pressed={selected}`. `data-testid="location-btn-{loc.toLowerCase()}"`.

#### Save / Cancel

- **Save**: calls `updateProfile(fields)` → navigates back (-1) on success; error shown in `role="alert" data-testid="save-error"`
- **Cancel**: calls `navigate(-1)` with no API call

### i18n Namespace: `ess` → `mobile.profile.*`

**New keys added (flat):** `employeeProfile`, `activeScore`, `profileCompleteness`, `completeHint`, `started`, `workPreferences`, `workLocations`, `present`, `editProfile`, `editTitle`, `save`, `contactDetails`, `addPreference`, `remove`, `noPreferences`, `noLocations`, `preferredLocation`, `avatarAlt`, `avatarHint`

**Preserved existing keys:** `personalInfo`, `email`, `phone`, `cancel`, `emergencyContact`, `department`, `title`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `startDate`, and change-request keys.

**Nested:** `pref.{fastFood, grocery, butcher, bakery, cafe}`
